// eoreader6 · scripts/experiments/resolve-span-role — EXPERIMENTAL, unwired.
//
// resolveSpanRole: a sibling to perceiver/text/pronouns.js::resolvePronouns,
// same shape, re-targeted. Where resolvePronouns binds a third-person
// pronoun to an already-NAMED referent by one-hop activation recall,
// resolveSpanRole binds an INSTANCE of a structurally ambiguous span (a
// surface form whose occurrences split across multiple induced kinds — see
// goldens/agency-civic/data/pos-superposition.json for how these were
// found) to an already-EVIDENCED kind, same mechanism, same floors.
//
// THE POINT THIS OPERATIONALIZES: a span's role is never a property of its
// surface form. "covered" is not an adjective or a verb; a given INSTANCE
// of "covered" already is one or the other (or something else), and the
// honest state before enough context has arrived is superposition, not a
// 55/45 split. Resolution happens causally, in reading order, from what the
// reading has evidenced so far — never a batch pass, never an average
// across all of a word's uses. Reuses activation.js completely unmodified.
//
// KIND REGISTRY: two coarse kinds built from role-fold-verb-island's own
// saved output, not re-induced here — this script consumes an existing
// kind vocabulary, it does not create one:
//   "actor"  — fillers whose surviving clusters were labeled pos:*before*
//              (BIA, EPA, FAA, Commission, Department, applicant...)
//   "predicate-complement" — fillers whose surviving clusters were labeled
//              pos:*after* (established, committed, accepted, applicable...)
// A word already unambiguous by this registry (appears in only one kind)
// marks that kind PRESENT in its sentence, exactly as a named surface marks
// a referent present for resolvePronouns. A word that is itself ambiguous
// (present in the registry under both kinds, or one of the flagged
// heterogeneous fillers) is a resolution TARGET, exactly as a pronoun is.
//
